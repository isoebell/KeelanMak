    <div class="bio">
        <p>This is actually <em>placeholder text</em> for the artist's bio. His instagram bio says "music dude and all round great guy"
            however maybe that is a bit too casual for here? He's a bipoc queer artist based in Melbourne, and has or is about to release
            his latest EP 'Boy's In Love,' I think that could be enough words for now. Also, he writes, creates, and produces his own music,
            right in his bedroom. And works two jobs full time. That's pretty cool.
